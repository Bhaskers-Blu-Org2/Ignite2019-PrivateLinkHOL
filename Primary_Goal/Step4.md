3.	Congrats, you are now using private file transfer to Azure over IPSec using your original DNS fqdn to Azure blob Storage, all with Private Link! 

4.	If you complete this task early, feel free to upload and download more data using your new Private Link service, and/or test other parts of your lab storage account. 

5.	When you are completely done, close the RDP session to VM-WIN-ON-PREM, but leave your browser tabs open to the lab portal and to the Azure portal.
