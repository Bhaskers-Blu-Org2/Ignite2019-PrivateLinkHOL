# Private PaaS with Private Link and DNS integration 

## Overview 
Private Link is an exciting new connectivity platform in Microsoft Azure that allow end users to build Private IP Endpoints in their VNet, and then securely link these endpoints to a variety of Private Link Services that live outside the VNet. 

Private Link Services can be built and maintained by Microsoft, such as Azure Storage and Azure SQL.  Private Link Services can also be built and maintained by other customers and 3rd parties within Azure. 

Private IP Endpoints are transitive, meaning, they are visible over VPN, ExpressRoute, and VNet peering.  Now you can extend private connectivity to services like Azure Storage and Azure SQL into your on-prem private network, and to other private networks within Azure, all at the same time!  

## Goals 
This lab features two goals: a primary goal which will be instructor led, and a secondary goal which you can complete yourself, with help from the proctors, as time allows.  Each goal is designed to be completed within 30 minutes and highlights a use case (adapted from real examples) where Private Link is a critical part of the solution.
